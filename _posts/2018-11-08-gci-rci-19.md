Two of India's long running, all-India conferences namely **GopherConIndia** and **RubyConfIndia** are being held in Goa in 2019. We have finalized Hotel Park Regis about 6 minutes further away from Resort Rio (which we had announced earlier) as the venue for the two conferences namely [GopherConIndia][GopherConIndia]{:target="_blank"} (5th year) and [RubyConfIndia][RubyConfIndia]{:target="_blank"} (10th year) from 18th to 21st Jan. 2019. The famous Baga beach is just 5 minutes away.

The resort:

*  Is in North Goa and close to all the action, beaches, restaurants and night clubs
*  Has extremely spacious rooms
*  Has three restaurants to cater to every taste

Some of you are saying that the price of Rs 8500 for 2 nights stay in the Park Regis is too high. High? Read above and check what all you get by staying at the resort.
